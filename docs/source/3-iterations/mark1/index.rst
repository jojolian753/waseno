=============
WASNO, Mark 1
=============

During the development planning, we ordered the list of tasks according
to the risk in terms of competence.

However for this project to be successful, at the end of the first iteration,
it is paramount to be able to connect the WASENO to a water line, and be able
to control four water outputs independently from the internet. So the tasks
in order of importance to accomplish our goal, will be:

- To figure out a way to connect/attach the input and outputs of the solenoid
  to the enclosure (does not have to be perfect, can be improved in the next
  iteration)
- have an edison fit in the enclosure.
- Find a driver board for the solenoid valves.
- Power the whole with a battery pack.
