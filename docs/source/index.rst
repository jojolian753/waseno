==================================
Welcome to WASENO's documentation!
==================================

Gardening is supposed to be fun. The teddious or boring repetitive tasks most
often hinder that. However those annoying tasks can be automated with a
:term:`CAG`.

The most boring task in the garden is perhaps pointing a hose around
to water your plants and vegtables. That is the problem that this project
intends to solve.

There are already commercial, and diy projects that solve this in numerous
ways, each project focusing on a particular aspect of the problem.

We'll be focusing on developping a watering sensor node. It can be seen as
a black box that will get water and soil moisture reading or time schedule,
and deliver water to plants (or garden regions). This black box will be
internet connected, where it can be queried and controlled.
