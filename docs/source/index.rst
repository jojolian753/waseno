==================================
Welcome to WASENO's documentation!
==================================

Gardening is supposed to be fun. The teddious or boring repetitive tasks most
often hinder that. However those annoying tasks can be automated with a
:term:`CAG`.

The most boring task in the garden is perhaps pointing a hose around
to water your plants and vegtables. That is the problem that this project
intends to solve.

We'll be developping a watering sensor node. It can be seen as a black box
that will get water and soil moisture reading or time schedule, and deliver
water to plants (or garden regions).
