    CAG
        Computer Assisted Gardening is a network of sensors and robots intended
        to make gardening easier and more manageable. Here the CAG is an army
        of robotic lawn mowers (number depends on lawn size), a weather
        station, an alarm system, and finally a network of watering sensor
        nodes.

        All the subsystems of the CAG are networked for collective
        intelligence, and managed through the home network using a mobile
        app, or RESTful interface.

        For example if the alarm system picks up activity in the garden,
        the lawn mower robot(s) will be notified to postpone any mowing
        activities. If it rains, watering sensor nodes might be notified
        to adjust watering schedule accordingly, or the weather station
        can help the watering sensor nodes to detect for instance
        discrepancies between moiture sensor readings and the weather
        stations's rain gauge.

    MCU
        MicroController Unit is a small computer on a single computer chip
        designed for embedded applications. It contains a processor core,
        memory, and programmable input/output peripherals connected through
        an addressable system bus.
